        <li>Add chicken to a hot pan and cook on both sides until brown, about 3-4 minutes. Chicken does not need to be fully cooked for this step, as it will finish cooking in another step, and we do not want to chicken breast to dry out. </li>
        <li>Once chicken breast is browned, pull it out,set it to the side, and add garlic and onion to pan.</li>
        <li>Once garlic and onion is added and browned, add rice and toast for 30 seconds.</li>

        <li>Stir in asparagus or broccoli, place lemon slices ontop of chicken, cover pan and let cook for 5 additional minutes. </li>
        <li>Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
